## Introduction
This project is a web-based Tic Tac Toe game where two players can play against each other. The game board is dynamically updated using JavaScript, and the game status is displayed to inform players of the current state of the game (e.g., who won, or if it's a draw).

## Features
- Interactive game board
- Dynamic DOM manipulation using JavaScript
- Responsive design with CSS
- Real-time game status updates
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## Technologies Used
1. <b>HTML</b>: Structure of the web page
2. <b>CSS</b>: Styling and layout of the game
3. <b>JavaScript</b>: Game logic and DOM manipulation

## How to Play
1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid.

4. Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to place their mark (X or O).
5. The game status is updated in real-time to show whose turn it is.
6. The game ends when one player gets three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or when all cells are filled without a winner (draw).
