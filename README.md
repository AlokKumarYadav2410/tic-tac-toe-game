## Introduction
This project is a web-based Tic Tac Toe game where two players can play against each other. The game board is dynamically updated using JavaScript, and the game status is displayed to inform players of the current state of the game (e.g., who won, or if it's a draw).

## Features
- Interactive game board
- Dynamic DOM manipulation using JavaScript
- Responsive design with CSS
- Real-time game status updates
- Simple and intuitive user interface

2. <b>CSS</b>: Styling and layout of the game
3. <b>JavaScript</b>: Game logic and DOM manipulation
